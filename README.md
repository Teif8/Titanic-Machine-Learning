# Titanic-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using various machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

## Installation
To install the required libraries, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Key Steps in the Notebook

	•	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Feature Engineering
	•	Applying Logistic Regression for Prediction
	•	Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score

 ## 2. titanic_ml.ipynb:

This notebook includes:

	•	Importing Libraries: As shown in your image.
	•	Loading Data: Loading the Titanic dataset using pd.read_csv().
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Checking for missing values, visualizing survival rates.
	•	Feature Engineering: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.
	•	Model Building: Using Logistic Regression to predict survival, as indicated in the code snippet.
	•	Model Evaluation: Using accuracy_score and possibly other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
